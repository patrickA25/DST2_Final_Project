# Data Sciences Tools Two Final Project

## Project overview
I wanted to see if adding macro-economic factors would increase the overall accurary when predicting if a customer will
churn in the next calender. If we are able to better perdict which customers will churn out then we can attempt to interviev
before they fully churn out or before they start the cancelation process entierly.
